This work was carried out as final project for the course *Advanced Topics in Machine Learning and Optimization*, with the supervision of PhD student Antonio Longa. The primary goal of this study was understanding whether the benefits that sheaf diffusion networks bring to node classification tasks can be someway exploited in a different context such as graph classification. 


Part of the code contained in the Jupyter Notebook comes from, or is an adaptation of, the official *Neural Sheaf Diffusion* code: https://github.com/twitter-research/neural-sheaf-diffusion
